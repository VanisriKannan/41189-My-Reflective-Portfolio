# My Reflective Portfolio
## *Week 1*

### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week I have learnt that I have interacted with systems more than I realise and that I have encountered and interacted with systems on a daily basis. I also learnt that the term system does not have one simple definition but can be concluded that it comprises of multiple elements and parts that are in vital relationships with each other. I learnt that complex systems show emergence properties as they behave in a way that is greater than the sum of their parts. Additionally, 

### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
I now know that the terms complex and complicated can be used interchangeably in the context of this course they have very different meanings. Before this lesson I was not aware that systems had boundaries such as open, closed and isolated, now I am able to identify the type of boundary a system has. From the pre work question, 

### **What insights have I gained?**
I have now come to the understanding that even simple systems can be very complex or complicated and example of this that was discussed in class was marriage. Although marriage is primarily a vital relationship of only two elements it can very complex. I gained the understanding that a system cannot be fully understood or managed merely by looking at its parts.

### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
This week I have 


### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**
This week I struggled with grasping all the complex and unfamiliar terms and concepts that were introduced to me. To overcome this challenge, I’m searching up terms that I am unsure of on the internet. I am also going back to the lecture slides once class has finished to consolidate my understanding of the content that was covered in class.



## *Week 2*
### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week I learned about the very important idea of many-model thinking which enables unbiased and accurate decisions to be made. Using a model enables us to reason, explain, design, communicate, act, predict and explore. Models about the world to understand and use large amounts of data to unpack patterns, find predictions and estimate hidden parameters. Ultimately, models are very beneficial resources that will enable us to make better decisions through strategizing and designing. I have also learned the three different types of models including the embodiment approach, analogy approach and the alternative reality models. 

### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
Before this lesson I did not know that models can be classified into categories such as the embodiment approach, analogy approach and the alternative reality models. Understanding the different types of models has enabled me to identify which models I have designed and interacted with. I did now about the power in numbers and the significant advantage that group think possess. However, after watching the video on the number of jellybeans in a jar and learning about how many people were able to identify the location of the missing, I am now are of the extent of its usefulness and power. 

### **What insights have I gained?**
After the completion of the discussion board activity I have come to the understanding that many-model thinking is practised in many areas of my life. I have discovered that many-model thinking plays a vital role in the health industry enabling health care workers to make accurate decisions when treating a patient. I also now understand why working in a team setting can sometimes be a very beneficial experience as groupthink can result in teams achieving successful outcomes. This idea of successful outcomes being achieved is evident in my life as my experiences of working in a team has allowed me to gain great knowledge.


### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
My strengths this week include my ability to reflect on my life and identify practice of many-model thinking at my workplace and recall the different types of models I have interacted with in my life. However, this week my weakness was not able to manage my time properly as I am writing this entry at the very last minute.

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**
This week I was comfortable with the concepts that I was taught in class therefore I was really engaged throughout the whole workshop.

### **What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**
The wisdom in numbers proved to be a very useful theory that was taught in today’s lesson. From this theory I have learnt that many people hold a large database of information that is unique from one another and through the use of group think this knowledge can be used to make decisions and solve problems effectively and efficiently.


## *Week 3*

### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week I learnt about the modelling of people which can be carried out in a rational, behaviour or rule-based manner and how they enable us to understand human psychology from different viewpoints. This week I have learnt about how models are able to provide explanations, insights and multiple perspectives on how people behave, decide, conceal or reveal information, add value in a group and solve problems in a group. Upon reflection, this week’s lesson has helped to realise that modelling people is not as difficult as I thought it is and that it can be accomplished by implementing different strategies. 


### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
After revising the concepts discussed in this week I am able to say that I now know how models are able to provide explanations, insight and multiple perspective on how people behave, decide, conceal or reveal information, add value in a group and solve problems in a groups. From the three different models I know that the rational behaviour model can be the most effective as it is a really good benchmark. However, people make systematic errors in rational thinking and often do not act optimally which can make it an unrealistic method of modelling. I know that as time proceeds, we learn rules of thumb and was intrigued to find that they often outperform the most sophisticated strategies. I understand that decision making models are created for normative and positive reasons and there are two types of problems; the multi-criterion and the under uncertainty. I now know that under uncertainty probability is essential for decision making and that decision trees are useful when there are contingencies as they allow us to infer how someone views the world. I know realise the value of information from the examples discussed in class as it can have a significant impact on decision making. I know that in a group people with differing power can add differing levels of value and this can be calculated using the LOTB or Shapley method. Understanding the contribution of each individual can be an effective way to identify how the cost or the payoff can be efficiently divided.


### **What insights have I gained?**
One interesting idea I learnt this week was that humans have two different types of thinking systems one fast that is intuitive and one slow that uses rigorous thinking, where the latter gives rise to cognitive biases. I have learnt that as time proceeds, we learn rules of thumb and was intrigued to find that they often outperform the most sophisticated strategies. When learning about the Shapley model and watching the video on ‘visiting friends in Europe’ I was able to realise that some of the decisions I have made loosely coincided with this method of thinking. I understand that when signalling, costliness carries more meaning and significance as evident in the ‘girl in the foyer’ story and how I can use signalling to improve my personal life.


### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
My strengths this week has been my ability to grasp on the key aspects of specific new concepts by reflecting on my past experiences. Although, I was overwhelmed with the amount of content this week but was happy to learn and expand my knowledge and am hoping to apply this knowledge effectively in my career. However, I have noticed a few weaknesses during this week’s lessons one being that I find it difficult to grasp a good understanding of the mathematical concepts that are introduced. I have also observed that my lack of time management is hindering my ability to write these reflective entries on time. 



### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**


### **What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**
The costly signalling theory proved to be very useful as it very true that costliness carries meaning and that the significance attached to something is felt in direct proportion to the expense in which it is communicated in. Additionally, the idea that humans have two different thinking systems, one fast that is intuitive, and one slow that uses rigorous thinking put forward by Danny Kahnemann was very interesting to me. This idea explains why there is systematic errors in the thinking system, and it is because some utilise the fast thinking system whereas others utilise the slow thinking system.

## *Week 4*

### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week I have learnt about the three different ways to represent complex adaptive systems which can be through system dynamic models, network models and agent-based models. The nature of a problem can be understood when we identify their drivers, which can be classified in to three different categories including feedbacks, time delays, and nonlinearities. System dynamic modelling is an iterative process of formulating hypothesis which seeks to capture feedbacks relevant to the problem by representing system structure and its features. Networks are powerful tools which allow us to gather vast amounts of information through the connections and interactions of nodes and its edges. Agent based modelling is an effective way to simulate the interactions amongst autonomous agents and understand the behaviours they give rise to 


### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
Looking back at the content and revising what I have learnt, I now know that system dynamic models, network models and agent-based models offer three new lenses of viewing the world. One important to concept I now know is that that the problems that we face today are driven by feedbacks, time delays and non-linearities. System dynamic models are a continual process of modelling what if experiments by recognizing which structures contain what latent behaviours and the conditions that release them. I understand that system dynamic models represent features such as sources, sinks, stocks, flows, rates, and constants to analyse their interdependencies with the use negative or positive feedbacks. I know that networks have an emergent functionality as they provide clear visual information on phenomenon and the interaction of entities. I am aware that the idea that the whole is more than the sum of its parts is greatly applied to agent-based modelling as its usefulness relies on the fact that it captures emergent phenomena through the interactions of its agents.


### **What insights have I gained?**
Draper Kauffman’s analogy was really interesting to me and provided me with a great understanding of the idea that a system functions as a whole. Kauffman compared a system to cow and explained that when the cow is divided in to two fragments its ceases to function. I have learnt that systems have to be dynamic and have emergent properties and that they are defined by the functionality of their interconnected parts. Agent based modelling was of my upmost interest this lesson as I now know that it can be used to understand difficult scenarios as well. The video on the modelling of the spread of covid-19 helped me understand that how capable these models are of producing extensive information of the complex patterns and behaviours amongst humans and the transmission of the virus. I also really enjoyed using the agent-based model program myself as it is a very accessible tool which improved my understanding of agent-based models and proved to me how effectively it can simulate the interaction between agents and emergent behaviour.


### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
This week my strengths lied in my ability to grasp the content particularly in regards of networks as I had learned a lot about this in high school. Thus, this week I was able to gain extensive amounts of knowledge and develop my understanding as I was briefly introduced to these concepts in high school and was not feeling overwhelmed. I have also observed that I have extended my learning to think about how I can incorporate my knowledge of these models to my assignment and am starting to plan ahead. 

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**
This week my team and I collaborated on working towards some ideas for the problem we will focus on for the assignment. My team and I came up with many great ideas but were struggling to select one of the problems to focus on as they were all very interesting. However, to solve this my team have decided to organise a team meeting so that we are able to discuss about each of the topics and come to a group decision on our final idea. My group and I have handled our difficulty in selecting a suitable problem for the assignment through effective communication which will enable us to be an efficient group.

### **What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**
This week upon reflection the network theory proved to be a very useful theory as it allows networks to be analysed by using graphical techniques. By depicting networks as graphs, we are able to understand them from a different perspective. Nodes and edges can be understood in terms of how connected they are, the length of their path, its preferential attachment and its structure along which forms an emerging function. This theory enables us to find a deeper meaning in the way that nodes and edges are connected and their interactions with other nodes.


## *Week 5*

### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week was focused on the mathematical concepts associated with complex systems, specifically probability distributions and how it can enable us to understand and develop an intuition on how actions and decisions can add up. Probability empowers us to see the world more clearly and allows us to make sense of the random events of life through inferring. I have learnt that it is important to be able to define the characteristics of the variable whose behaviour we want to describe and identify the correct distribution that should be applied to model the particular process. The normal distribution and the long-tailed distributions are two types of distribution that aid in our understanding of human behaviour and socio-technical systems. 


### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
While revising the content I have learnt this week it is very similar to the topics that were introduced to me in the subject business statistics which I undertake as a part of my business degree. I know that probability distributions enable us to generalise the behaviour of random variable however to do this it is essential to define the characteristic of the random variable and fit into the right distribution. It is important that the random variable fits into the right distribution so that the model’s outcome has the correct probability and is able to be tested against real data. I understand that inferring is an easier method than dealing with real life and this can be done through probability distribution methodologies such as point estimation, interval estimation or hypothesis tests. Normal distributions are preferred as they depend on the mean or the average independent random variables to reduce the likelihood of large events, however, not all distributions are normal. Thus, I understand that some quantities are log normally distributed, are a product of independent variables and take on positive values only. Long tailed distributions are evident in today’s world as it becomes more interconnected and the number of feedbacks increase. I now know that in power law distributions we are left with only a few big winners and many losers however social effects are capable of creating bigger winners.


### **What insights have I gained?**
During this lecture I was able to realise that probability has so many real-world applications and is not just related to coin tosses and a deck of cards that is frequently taught to us. I have realised how the great role probability has in my life and how heavily I rely on it to make decisions. The idea of generalising the random variable is something I have frequently done when making a decision as I compare the outcomes I have encountered when making a specific decision. 


### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
This week my strength lies in the fact that I was able to apply the knowledge I have learnt in the subject Business Statistics that I am currently undertaking for my business. I have also observed that although mathematics is not my favourite subject, I have developed a willingness to learn and improve my mathematical abilities. Unfortunately, I have observed one unpleasant weakness which is that I have been procrastinating and not dedicating enough hours for revising the content I have learnt in class. I have observed is that when I learn about complex concepts, I am not familiar with my attention starts to deteriorate, I noticed this especially when learning about long tailed distributions.

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**
This week the major challenge I experienced was inability to sufficiently organise time and give in to procrastination which affected my ability to solidify my understanding of the content that I am learning. I hope to improve this by setting a time limit on how much time I will spend on activities other than studying. Hopefully next week I am able to keep on track and use my time effectively to revise. Another challenge I encountered was my inability to stay completely focused on concepts that I am unfamiliar with. To overcome this, I will ensure to notice the deterioration of concentration and push myself to preserver so that I am able to update my knowledge in new ways.

### **What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**
In this week’s lecture the central limit theorem proved to be useful, this theory states that if a number of more than 20 agent of independent decisions are added or averaged their distribution will be normally distributed. This theory can be applied because a lot of the random variables are bound by some kind of constraint make the random events of life more predictable. Furthermore, I have learnt that this theorem allows us to effectively model for aggregating decisions in groups of people.
