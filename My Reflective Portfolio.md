# My Reflective Portfolio
## *Week 1*

### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week I have learnt that I have interacted with systems more than I realise and that I have encountered and interacted with systems on a daily basis. I also learnt that the term system does not have one simple definition but can be concluded that it comprises of multiple elements and parts that are in vital relationships with each other. I learnt that complex systems show emergence properties as they behave in a way that is greater than the sum of their parts. Additionally, 

### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
I now know that the terms complex and complicated can be used interchangeably in the context of this course they have very different meanings. Before this lesson I was not aware that systems had boundaries such as open, closed and isolated, now I am able to identify the type of boundary a system has. From the pre work question, 

### **What insights have I gained?**
I have now come to the understanding that even simple systems can be very complex or complicated and example of this that was discussed in class was marriage. Although marriage is primarily a vital relationship of only two elements it can very complex. I gained the understanding that a system cannot be fully understood or managed merely by looking at its parts.

### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**



### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**
This week I struggled with grasping all the complex and unfamiliar terms and concepts that were introduced to me. To overcome this challenge, I’m searching up terms that I am unsure of on the internet. I am also going back to the lecture slides once class has finished to consolidate my understanding of the content that was covered in class.

## *Week 2*
### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week I learned about the very important idea of many-model thinking which enables unbiased and accurate decisions to be made. Using a model enables us to reason, explain, design, communicate, act, predict and explore. Models about the world to understand and use large amounts of data to unpack patterns, find predictions and estimate hidden parameters. Ultimately, models are very beneficial resources that will enable us to make better decisions through strategizing and designing. I have also learned the three different types of models including the embodiment approach, analogy approach and the alternative reality models. 

### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
Before this lesson I did not know that models can be classified into categories such as the embodiment approach, analogy approach and the alternative reality models. Understanding the different types of models has enabled me to identify which models I have designed and interacted with. I did now about the power in numbers and the significant advantage that group think possess. However, after watching the video on the number of jellybeans in a jar and learning about how many people were able to identify the location of the missing, I am now are of the extent of its usefulness and power. 

### **What insights have I gained?**
After the completion of the discussion board activity I have come to the understanding that many-model thinking is practised in many areas of my life. I have discovered that many-model thinking plays a vital role in the health industry enabling health care workers to make accurate decisions when treating a patient. I also now understand why working in a team setting can sometimes be a very beneficial experience as groupthink can result in teams achieving successful outcomes. This idea of successful outcomes being achieved is evident in my life as my experiences of working in a team has allowed me to gain great knowledge.


### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
My strengths this week include my ability to reflect on my life and identify practice of many-model thinking at my workplace and recall the different types of models I have interacted with in my life. However, this week my weakness was not able to manage my time properly as I am writing this entry at the very last minute.

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**
This week I was comfortable with the concepts that I was taught in class therefore I was really engaged throughout the whole workshop.

### **What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**
The wisdom in numbers proved to be a very useful theory that was taught in today’s lesson. From this theory I have learnt that many people hold a large database of information that is unique from one another and through the use of group think this knowledge can be used to make decisions and solve problems effectively and efficiently.
