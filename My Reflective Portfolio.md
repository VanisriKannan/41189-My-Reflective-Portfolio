# My Reflective Portfolio
## *Week 1*

### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week I have learnt that I have interacted with systems more than I realise and that I have encountered and interacted with systems on a daily basis. I also learnt that the term system does not have one simple definition but can be concluded that it comprises of multiple elements and parts that are in vital relationships with each other. I learnt that complex systems show emergence properties as they behave in a way that is greater than the sum of their parts. Additionally, 

### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
I now know that the terms complex and complicated can be used interchangeably in the context of this course they have very different meanings. Before this lesson I was not aware that systems had boundaries such as open, closed and isolated, now I am able to identify the type of boundary a system has. From the pre work question, 

### **What insights have I gained?**
I have now come to the understanding that even simple systems can be very complex or complicated and example of this that was discussed in class was marriage. Although marriage is primarily a vital relationship of only two elements it can very complex. I gained the understanding that a system cannot be fully understood or managed merely by looking at its parts.

### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**



### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**
This week I struggled with grasping all the complex and unfamiliar terms and concepts that were introduced to me. To overcome this challenge, Iâ€™m searching up terms that I am unsure of on the internet. I am also going back to the lecture slides once class has finished to consolidate my understanding of the content that was covered in class.
