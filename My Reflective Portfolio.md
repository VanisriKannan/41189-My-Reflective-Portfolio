# My Reflective Portfolio
## *Week 1*

### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week I have learnt that I have interacted with systems more than I realise and that I have encountered and interacted with systems on a daily basis. I also learnt that the term system does not have one simple definition but can be concluded that it comprises of multiple elements and parts that are in vital relationships with each other. I learnt that complex systems show emergence properties as they behave in a way that is greater than the sum of their individual parts. Additionally, I have learnt that complex adaptive systems have an ability to self-organise, show emergence without a central control and usually involve humans. 

### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
I now know that the terms complex and complicated cannot be used interchangeably especially in the context of this course as they have very different meanings. Before this lesson I was not aware that systems had boundaries such as open, closed and isolated, now I am able to identify the type of boundary a system has. 

### **What insights have I gained?**
I have now come to the understanding that even simple systems can be very complex or complicated and example of this that was discussed in class was marriage. Although marriage is primarily a vital relationship of only two elements it can very complex. I gained the understanding that a system cannot be fully understood or managed merely by looking at its parts.

### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
This week I have not noticed any major strengths or weaknesses as it is only the first lesson.

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**
This week I struggled with grasping all the complex and unfamiliar terms and concepts that were introduced to me. To overcome this challenge, I’m searching up terms that I am unsure of on the internet. I am also going back to the lecture slides once class has finished to consolidate my understanding of the content that was covered in class.

## *Week 2*
### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week I learned about the very important idea of many-model thinking which enables unbiased and accurate decisions to be made. Using a model enables us to reason, explain, design, communicate, act, predict and explore. Models about the world to understand and use large amounts of data to unpack patterns, find predictions and estimate hidden parameters. Ultimately, models are very beneficial resources that will enable us to make better decisions through strategizing and designing. I have also learned the three different types of models including the embodiment approach, analogy approach and the alternative reality models. 

### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
Before this lesson I did not know that models can be classified into categories such as the embodiment approach, analogy approach and the alternative reality models. Understanding the different types of models has enabled me to identify which models I have designed and interacted with. I did now about the power in numbers and the significant advantage that group think possess. However, after watching the video on the number of jellybeans in a jar and learning about how many people were able to identify the location of the missing, I am now are of the extent of its usefulness and power. 

### **What insights have I gained?**
After the completion of the discussion board activity I have come to the understanding that many-model thinking is practised in many areas of my life. I have discovered that many-model thinking plays a vital role in the health industry enabling health care workers to make accurate decisions when treating a patient. I also now understand why working in a team setting can sometimes be a very beneficial experience as groupthink can result in teams achieving successful outcomes. This idea of successful outcomes being achieved is evident in my life as my experiences of working in a team has allowed me to gain great knowledge.

### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
My strengths this week include my ability to reflect on my life and identify practice of many-model thinking at my workplace and recall the different types of models I have interacted with in my life. However, this week my weakness was not able to manage my time properly as I am writing this entry at the very last minute.

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**
This week I was comfortable with the concepts that I was taught in class therefore I was really engaged throughout the whole workshop.

### **What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**
The wisdom in numbers proved to be a very useful theory that was taught in today’s lesson. From this theory I have learnt that many people hold a large database of information that is unique from one another and through the use of group think this knowledge can be used to make decisions and solve problems effectively and efficiently.

## *Week 3*

### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week I learnt about the modelling of people which can be carried out in a rational, behaviour or rule-based manner and how they enable us to understand human psychology from different viewpoints. This week I have learnt about how models are able to provide explanations, insights and multiple perspectives on how people behave, decide, conceal or reveal information, add value in a group and solve problems in a group. Upon reflection, this week’s lesson has helped to realise that modelling people is not as difficult as I thought it is and that it can be accomplished by implementing different strategies. 

### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
After revising the concepts discussed in this week I am able to say that I now know how models are able to provide explanations, insight and multiple perspective on how people behave, decide, conceal or reveal information, add value in a group and solve problems in a groups. From the three different models I know that the rational behaviour model can be the most effective as it is a really good benchmark. However, people make systematic errors in rational thinking and often do not act optimally which can make it an unrealistic method of modelling. I know that as time proceeds, we learn rules of thumb and was intrigued to find that they often outperform the most sophisticated strategies. I understand that decision making models are created for normative and positive reasons and there are two types of problems; the multi-criterion and the under uncertainty. I now know that under uncertainty probability is essential for decision making and that decision trees are useful when there are contingencies as they allow us to infer how someone views the world. I know realise the value of information from the examples discussed in class as it can have a significant impact on decision making. I know that in a group people with differing power can add differing levels of value and this can be calculated using the LOTB or Shapley method. Understanding the contribution of each individual can be an effective way to identify how the cost or the payoff can be efficiently divided.

### **What insights have I gained?**
One interesting idea I learnt this week was that humans have two different types of thinking systems one fast that is intuitive and one slow that uses rigorous thinking, where the latter gives rise to cognitive biases. I have learnt that as time proceeds, we learn rules of thumb and was intrigued to find that they often outperform the most sophisticated strategies. When learning about the Shapley model and watching the video on ‘visiting friends in Europe’ I was able to realise that some of the decisions I have made loosely coincided with this method of thinking. I understand that when signalling, costliness carries more meaning and significance as evident in the ‘girl in the foyer’ story and how I can use signalling to improve my personal life.

### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
My strengths this week has been my ability to grasp on the key aspects of specific new concepts by reflecting on my past experiences. Although, I was overwhelmed with the amount of content this week but was happy to learn and expand my knowledge and am hoping to apply this knowledge effectively in my career. However, I have noticed a few weaknesses during this week’s lessons one being that I find it difficult to grasp a good understanding of the mathematical concepts that are introduced. I have also observed that my lack of time management is hindering my ability to write these reflective entries on time. 

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**

### **What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**
The costly signalling theory proved to be very useful as it very true that costliness carries meaning and that the significance attached to something is felt in direct proportion to the expense in which it is communicated in. Additionally, the idea that humans have two different thinking systems, one fast that is intuitive, and one slow that uses rigorous thinking put forward by Danny Kahnemann was very interesting to me. This idea explains why there is systematic errors in the thinking system, and it is because some utilise the fast thinking system whereas others utilise the slow thinking system.

## *Week 4*

### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week I have learnt about the three different ways to represent complex adaptive systems which can be through system dynamic models, network models and agent-based models. The nature of a problem can be understood when we identify their drivers, which can be classified in to three different categories including feedbacks, time delays, and nonlinearities. System dynamic modelling is an iterative process of formulating hypothesis which seeks to capture feedbacks relevant to the problem by representing system structure and its features. Networks are powerful tools which allow us to gather vast amounts of information through the connections and interactions of nodes and its edges. Agent based modelling is an effective way to simulate the interactions amongst autonomous agents and understand the behaviours they give rise to 

### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
Looking back at the content and revising what I have learnt, I now know that system dynamic models, network models and agent-based models offer three new lenses of viewing the world. One important to concept I now know is that that the problems that we face today are driven by feedbacks, time delays and non-linearities. System dynamic models are a continual process of modelling what if experiments by recognizing which structures contain what latent behaviours and the conditions that release them. I understand that system dynamic models represent features such as sources, sinks, stocks, flows, rates, and constants to analyse their interdependencies with the use negative or positive feedbacks. I know that networks have an emergent functionality as they provide clear visual information on phenomenon and the interaction of entities. I am aware that the idea that the whole is more than the sum of its parts is greatly applied to agent-based modelling as its usefulness relies on the fact that it captures emergent phenomena through the interactions of its agents.

### **What insights have I gained?**
Draper Kauffman’s analogy was really interesting to me and provided me with a great understanding of the idea that a system functions as a whole. Kauffman compared a system to cow and explained that when the cow is divided in to two fragments its ceases to function. I have learnt that systems have to be dynamic and have emergent properties and that they are defined by the functionality of their interconnected parts. Agent based modelling was of my upmost interest this lesson as I now know that it can be used to understand difficult scenarios as well. The video on the modelling of the spread of covid-19 helped me understand that how capable these models are of producing extensive information of the complex patterns and behaviours amongst humans and the transmission of the virus. I also really enjoyed using the agent-based model program myself as it is a very accessible tool which improved my understanding of agent-based models and proved to me how effectively it can simulate the interaction between agents and emergent behaviour.

### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
This week my strengths lied in my ability to grasp the content particularly in regards of networks as I had learned a lot about this in high school. Thus, this week I was able to gain extensive amounts of knowledge and develop my understanding as I was briefly introduced to these concepts in high school and was not feeling overwhelmed. I have also observed that I have extended my learning to think about how I can incorporate my knowledge of these models to my assignment and am starting to plan ahead. 

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**
This week my team and I collaborated on working towards some ideas for the problem we will focus on for the assignment. My team and I came up with many great ideas but were struggling to select one of the problems to focus on as they were all very interesting. However, to solve this my team have decided to organise a team meeting so that we are able to discuss about each of the topics and come to a group decision on our final idea. My group and I have handled our difficulty in selecting a suitable problem for the assignment through effective communication which will enable us to be an efficient group.

### **What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**
This week upon reflection the network theory proved to be a very useful theory as it allows networks to be analysed by using graphical techniques. By depicting networks as graphs, we are able to understand them from a different perspective. Nodes and edges can be understood in terms of how connected they are, the length of their path, its preferential attachment and its structure along which forms an emerging function. This theory enables us to find a deeper meaning in the way that nodes and edges are connected and their interactions with other nodes.

## *Week 5*

### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week was focused on the mathematical concepts associated with complex systems, specifically probability distributions and how it can enable us to understand and develop an intuition on how actions and decisions can add up. Probability empowers us to see the world more clearly and allows us to make sense of the random events of life through inferring. I have learnt that it is important to be able to define the characteristics of the variable whose behaviour we want to describe and identify the correct distribution that should be applied to model the particular process. The normal distribution and the long-tailed distributions are two types of distribution that aid in our understanding of human behaviour and socio-technical systems. 

### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
While revising the content I have learnt this week it is very similar to the topics that were introduced to me in the subject business statistics which I undertake as a part of my business degree. I know that probability distributions enable us to generalise the behaviour of random variable however to do this it is essential to define the characteristic of the random variable and fit into the right distribution. It is important that the random variable fits into the right distribution so that the model’s outcome has the correct probability and is able to be tested against real data. I understand that inferring is an easier method than dealing with real life and this can be done through probability distribution methodologies such as point estimation, interval estimation or hypothesis tests. Normal distributions are preferred as they depend on the mean or the average independent random variables to reduce the likelihood of large events, however, not all distributions are normal. Thus, I understand that some quantities are log normally distributed, are a product of independent variables and take on positive values only. Long tailed distributions are evident in today’s world as it becomes more interconnected and the number of feedbacks increase. I now know that in power law distributions we are left with only a few big winners and many losers however social effects are capable of creating bigger winners.

### **What insights have I gained?**
During this lecture I was able to realise that probability has so many real-world applications and is not just related to coin tosses and a deck of cards that is frequently taught to us. I have realised how the great role probability has in my life and how heavily I rely on it to make decisions. The idea of generalising the random variable is something I have frequently done when making a decision as I compare the outcomes I have encountered when making a specific decision. 


### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
This week my strength lies in the fact that I was able to apply the knowledge I have learnt in the subject Business Statistics that I am currently undertaking for my business. I have also observed that although mathematics is not my favourite subject, I have developed a willingness to learn and improve my mathematical abilities. Unfortunately, I have observed one unpleasant weakness which is that I have been procrastinating and not dedicating enough hours for revising the content I have learnt in class. I have observed is that when I learn about complex concepts, I am not familiar with my attention starts to deteriorate, I noticed this especially when learning about long tailed distributions.

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**
This week the major challenge I experienced was inability to sufficiently organise time and give in to procrastination which affected my ability to solidify my understanding of the content that I am learning. I hope to improve this by setting a time limit on how much time I will spend on activities other than studying. Hopefully next week I am able to keep on track and use my time effectively to revise. Another challenge I encountered was my inability to stay completely focused on concepts that I am unfamiliar with. To overcome this, I will ensure to notice the deterioration of concentration and push myself to preserver so that I am able to update my knowledge in new ways.

### **What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**
In this week’s lecture the central limit theorem proved to be useful, this theory states that if a number of more than 20 agent of independent decisions are added or averaged their distribution will be normally distributed. This theory can be applied because a lot of the random variables are bound by some kind of constraint make the random events of life more predictable. Furthermore, I have learnt that this theorem allows us to effectively model for aggregating decisions in groups of people.

## *Week 6*

### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week updated my knowledge on how systems evolve through the understanding of the two stochastic models; markov and random walks and how ideas, information, technologies, behaviours and diseases can be spread through broadcasting, diffusion and contagion. Markov models highlight the idea that systems have predefined states and undergo evolution as entities transition between those states according to a certain probability. Markov models have a vast variety of applications and can be used to model any system by determining the interaction of entities with different states. Random walk models can assist us to make effective choices when decision making. Additionally, I have learnt the meaning behind the infamous statement by mathematician Shizuo Kakutani who quoted that “a drunk man will find his way home, but a drunk bird may get lost forever”.  

### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
After looking back at the content and revising the content that was introduced, I know have a greater understanding of markov models and random walks and how ideas, information, technologies, behaviours and diseases can be spread through riots, broadcasting, diffusion and contagion. I now know the markov processes have underlying assumption which are that they have a finite number of states, have fixed transition probabilities, are eventually able to transition from any state to another and that they do not cycle between states. I understand that Random walk models contrary to intuition never diverge as each random step that is taken is identically and independently distributed. Studying the random walks model helped me understand how I can improve my decision-making skills. These steps include identifying and focusing on the most important decisions, delegating or compromising small decisions and assigning a period of time for the decision-making process to make the most of time. The broadcast, diffusion and contagion models detailed the importance of communication and how communication happens. These models always place someone between two different groups; uninformed to informed or susceptible to infected.

### **What insights have I gained?**
The content from last and this week has provided the insight of the extent of the usefulness of probability. I am aware that probability has enabled to be a more educated member of society who is able to make effective decisions. Furthermore, the stochastic models that were explored this week helped me realise that these models can be applied to a variety of different scenarios, one in which interested me the most being the diagnoses of a patient. In general, learning about these models has greatly expanded my knowledge as they breakdown the complexities that surround a system into a number of steps which makes it easier to understand their mechanism. I have also come to the realisation that I am a very path dependent person as the decisions that I make are reliant on past actions of my friends and family, even if these decisions result in a less favourable outcome. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia has benefitted from the SIR model, through the creation of the COVID safe app which has assisted in the containing the spread of this virus. 

### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
This week I have noticed many strengths as I am feeling greatly encouraged to engage with the content and take the initiative of engaging with the self-study elements. I also notice myself actively taking more time to understand the things that happen around me. 

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**
This week my team and I were working on the assignment, the component of the task I focused on required me to identify and discuss the existing frames or models that being used to address or resolve gender inequality experienced by women during COVID-19. I encountered great difficulty in finding models or frames that were currently being used to address this. To overcome this difficulty, I allocated a few hours of researching over a course of three days and every day I was able to gain a different perspective and a deeper level of understanding of this multifaceted issue. This then allowed me to realise that the main focus was entirely on containing spread of the virus that the exacerbation of gender inequality faced by women was overlooked. 

### **What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**
This week learning about the markov convergence theorem was useful as it explained that if the four underlying assumptions of Markov processes are met it converges towards a unique equilibrium. Which means that the initial conditions, history and intervening to change states do not matter and that if transition probabilities are the same, change is temporary. From this one can understand that in order to create a change in the system it is important to focus on making the transition probabilities more permanent. This is useful as many systems strive towards a change but are often not able to create it and identifying the factor that can enable change is crucial knowledge. 

## *Week 7*

### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week I have learnt about why and how things spread, how we coordinate, how culture arises and social learning through a range of different models. Three agent-based models namely, the Schelling segregation model, Granovetter’s Riot model and the Standing ovation model demonstrated the concept of peer effects and social contagion. Pure coordination games and the Axelrod model demonstrated how individuals coordinate and modelled culture. This week also outlined the usefulness of the social learning model replicator dynamics which are utilised in psychology, economics and ecology. 

### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
When reflecting on the content learnt this week, I now have a greater understanding of why and how things spread, how we coordinate, how culture arises and social learning. Learning about the Schelling segregation model helped me understand the idea of how micro-motives do not equal to macro-behaviour. On the other hand, the Granovetter’s Riot model helped understand how small groups of people can drive something from the micro to the macro and how varying thresholds lead to varying outcomes. This week through the study of peer effects and social contagion models I understand that social contagion contrary to belief is driven by high variance rather than mean behaviour. From the extended standing ovation model, I am aware of how people seated at the front are not influenced by anyone but have the power of influencing the rest of the audience. Thus, those who sit at the front and engage in a standing ovation have more security over their opinions and have low social conformity compared to those seated at the back who can’t be seen anyone but can see everyone and are usually of high social conformity. I now know that culture can be modelled as a pure coordination game where no one would choose not to coordinate as there is a measurable difference in payoffs. Furthermore, the Axelrod model helped me realise how culture is built upon coherence and consistency and that minute errors can lead to substantial heterogeneity at a population level. 

### **What insights have I gained?**
The sociological phenomena of Homophily was something that I was aware of in the back of my mind and noticed when seeing groups of people together at social gatherings such as parties. However, it was not until this lesson I consciously acknowledged it and identified this within my life. After learning about the Schelling model, I was able to take a step back and observe the interactions around me and realise how separated the world is and how groups of like-minded people tend to group together. I realise how high-income earners cluster around specific suburbs similarly, people of the same culture also cluster around specific suburbs. A model which sparked a lot of interest within me was the standing ovation model, as I never thought that a standing ovation was filled with such complexity and I never considered the extent to which peer effects and group dynamics can impact an individual to partake in the standing ovation. When reflecting back on the instances where I myself have stood up during a performance, I realise how great of an impact peer effects and group dynamics had on my decision to stand up and applaud the performance. 

### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
This week as mentioned in previous weeks, my strengths lie in my ability to understand concepts and apply the knowledge I have gained to understand the interactions that happen in my life. After every lesson I realise that I am more conscious of the world I live in and more aware of the interactions that I experience. As a result, I have not observed any weaknesses this week.

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**
This week I did not encounter any significant challenges when engaging with the content during class or completing the assignment with my team members. I was very comfortable with the content and am encouraged to apply my understanding in a variety of different ways. Moreover, my team has been very efficient in completing tasks and collectively collaborating our ideas for the assignment. 

### **What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**
The sociological theory of homophily helped me understand the idea of how ‘like attracts like’ contrary to the idea that opposites attract. Especially, this week, the theory of homophily aided in developing my understanding of the Schelling segregation model, Granovetter’s Riot model and the Standing ovation model. Additionally, the fisher’s theorem was a useful theory as it helped me understand that the rate of adaptation is proportional to the variation in a population. This theory added to my understanding of evolution as it is very evident that more the variation the faster the adaptation to an optimal state. When containing the spread of COVID-19 there is great variance; some choose to wear or not wear a mask, and some choose to abide by the social distancing guidelines or not to abide by the social distancing guidelines. Amongst this variance it is evident that those who choose to wear a mask and abide by the social distancing guidelines are the optimum as they protect themselves from being at risk of being infected and ultimately aid in the containing of the virus.

## *Week 8*

### **What have I learnt this week?**
This week was focused on the colonel blotto game and the prisoner’s dilemma, which are two models of game theory. Game theory is a framework in which social interactions are seen among ‘players’ to involve strategy, competition and cooperation. These models updated my knowledge on the emergent behaviours of complex systems and deepened my understanding on the content that was covered last week. 

### **What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**
While revising the content I have learnt this week, I now have a greater understanding on the colonel blotto game and the prisoner’s dilemma and how they are widely applicable models of game theory that can be easily adapted from one setting to another. When learning about the colonel blotto game I understand how the underdogs who are perceived as those who have no chance of winning can actually win, due to the fact that there is no best strategy. I now know that when one player is starting of as the week player with less troops, adding fronts can increase that players chances of winning. Additionally, from learning about the game theory of the colonel blotto I am able to understand how that having more resources does not guarantee a victory. This is because regardless of the number of resources each player has, a player can only aim to achieve victory if they ensure they allocate their resources in an effective manner. I am now aware that apart from the obvious military setting the colonel blotto has a vast range of applications including US elections, terrorism, trials, hiring and sports. The prisoner’s dilemma is a cooperation game which captures the tension between cooperation and defection, it is better to cooperate however, there is a question of whether it is worth incurring a cost. I am now aware of the wider applications of the prisoner’s dilemma, it can be used to model: arms control, price competition and technological adoption. I have now come to know that for example in the domain of price competition the Nash equilibrium is used by economists to determine how companies will respond to their competitors’ prices.

### **What insights have I gained?**
The colonel blotto game has clearly emphasised to me, specifically in the area of job applications on the importance of making sure that I am equipped with a range of skills and abilities rather than dedicating my efforts in perfecting only one specific skill, ability or knowledge base. This game theory made me reflect upon my decisions regarding my academic life, as after graduating from high school I was contemplating on whether I should take up a software engineering degree or a double degree in information systems and business. However, when weighing up the two degrees side by side I was determined to study the degree that will give me a greater extent of knowledge, skills and abilities. Thus, I have chosen to pursue the double degree in information systems and business as it will expand my knowledge in two faculties of academics rather than solely focusing on specific faculty of study. Applying the game theory of the colonel blotto to the assignment topic my team has chosen; the impact COVID-19 has had on gender inequality, I am able to understand the reason behind the decreased levels of women’s employment from a new perspective. This is clearly depicted when looking at the difference between men and women while applying for a job. Studies report that women cut themselves short by only applying to jobs they feel they meet all the requirements for however, men apply regardless of whether they meet all the requirements; increasing their chances of getting a job and having more exposure to job interviews. Furthermore, women tend to screen themselves of whether they think they should apply for a job and decide they do not meet all the requirements. 

### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
This week as similarly mentioned in previous weeks, I noticed that I was very keen to engage with the content in class and was really interested in gaining more knowledge on these models. Additionally, I observed that I have been able to grasp on to the concepts that have been discussed and reflect upon my life. As aforementioned, I notice myself actively taking more time to understand the things that happen around me especially after learning about the prisoner’s dilemma. 

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**
This week the pre-submission component of the assignment was due, thus the team and I were finalising our components so that we could bring it all together into one formatted repository on Github. The team worked very efficiently and used this week to organise a few group calls via zoom to ensure everyone was on the same page and helped one another through any difficulties when completing the assignment. As a result of the team initially working on the assignment through google docs, we were able to read upon one another’s components and give feedback or suggest any ideas. This has been effective as we did not have to leave anything to last minute and efficiently completed the assignment on time. There was a challenge the team encountered as we needed to ensure our work was cohesive. However, the team easily overcame this challenge by editing one another’s components on google docs and utilising our group calls on zoom to clarify any confusion. 

## *Week 9*
### **What insights have I gained?**
This week’s task was to give the group we have been assigned to feedback on the pre-submission for their assignment. By engaging with the other group’s submission, I have been able to apply my knowledge of writing reports. When writing the feedback on their submission I have been able to reflect on my group assignment and identify areas of improvement that can be implemented into our assignment as well. Additionally, when reviewing the other group’s submission, I realised the importance of having well defined data sources as it helps provide further explanation on how the model is an appropriate model to help resolve this issue. From engaging in this task, I was able to understand the possibilities of GitHub as I learnt how to open an issue to write my feedback. 

### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
Upon reflection, this week I have identified my strengths in the ability for me to thoroughly understand the other group’s assignment and provide useful constructive feedback, by suggesting changes that can be made for better clarification and cohesion. Much like the previous weeks, I have realised that I am able to carry out research in an efficient manner to find the information I am looking for. Additionally, I have observed that if I am unclear about something, I’m willing to seek help which is a great strength that can help me expand my knowledge not only in this subject but in life. As a result of this week being focused on developing our assignment and completing the peer feedback, I have not observed any weaknesses this week as I both understood and was comfortable with the tasks I had to complete.

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**
My team and I have been very efficient in the completion of the pre-submission task by overcoming challenges in a collaborative manner. As a result, in preparation for completing the final report the team once again separated the component into four smaller sections where one member did one component. The team and I have organised group meetings this week to ensure that everyone was comfortable with the tasks that are to completed for the final submission. During this meeting via zoom the team and I created mini deadlines in which to have each task completed by so that we are motivated to complete them rather than waiting until last minute.

## *Week 10*
### **What insights have I gained?**
This week the team and I were completely focused on working on the final group assignment and completing our components of the task. Similar to last week’s class, the team and I utilised the time we had in the breakout rooms to discuss with one another each other’s progress. During the group meeting in the breakout room we were able to help one another and build on one another’s knowledge to ensure that we are completing the report to the best of our abilities. This week I realised that I had not thought much about the implementation of the models in terms of coding, as I am very new to coding and am still learning the basics in the subject programming fundamentals which I currently undertake. Thus, this meant that I had to dedicate a few hours of research and watching YouTube videos to familiarise myself and gain knowledge on how to implement these models with code.

### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
Upon reflection, this week much like the previous weeks, my strengths lie in my ability to carry out research or ask for help to seek the information I am looking for, clear up any confusions and gain further information and direction. One weakness that was evident this week was as a result of my lack of experience and knowledge with coding. This led me to feel a little discouraged and unmotivated as I was unable to understand the resources that were available online as those codes were quite difficult to manipulate into the model that I wanted. However, I was motivated to overcome this challenge by dedicating some of my time to gain knowledge on Agent Based models and how to code them. I also found that the Schelling segregation model code was very useful in giving me more insight on agent-based models and how to code for them.

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**
The team much like the previous week have frequently arranged group meetings via zoom to collaborate with one another, discuss ideas and help build on one another’s knowledge. However, one particular struggle I experienced was with my unfamiliarity with coding which led me to struggle with not knowing how to create sufficient codes of an agent-based model. As a result of my lack of experience with coding I aimed to overcome this obstacle by searching up templates of code that can be altered to fit the context of our social issue. I have also watched numerous YouTube videos to gain more knowledge on the models and how I can aim to implement them into codes.

## *Week 11*
### **What insights have I gained?**
This week was completely focused on completing the final assignment very much like last week. While looking up suitable codes I have realised that there is a vast amount of codes available on GitHub which has been very helpful as it is difficult to create a full functioning coding of a model from scratch without being familiar with programming. I have also come to the understanding that the agent-based model in the context of the exacerbation of gender inequality following the COVID-19 pandemic is quite difficult to code. This difficulty arises from the agent-based models’ emergent properties; thus, it is very difficult to define this social issue in terms of code. However, I have come to the realisation that the preferential attachment model can be much more effective in addressing this social issue by observing the networks of how specific connection can impact people. 

### **What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**
This week one strength that has helped me overcome a struggle is my ability to look for other solutions to solve the issue I am facing which is evident in my decision to address the social issue with a preferential attachment model rather than an agent-based model. Making this decision has allowed me to focus on other activities and more specifically dedicate my time in implementing a suitable code. However, one weakness I observed is that when I encounter something that is difficult, I tend to initially feel unmotivated. After realising this weakness again, I have pushed myself to take this as an opportunity to broaden my knowledge.

### **What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**
As previously mentioned, my lack of experience and knowledge with coding has made it difficult for me to create and edit codes. Thus, one major obstacle I encountered this week was that I was unable to create an agent based with codes. However, when encountering this obstacle, I decided that it can be overcome with the use of the preferential attachment model.
